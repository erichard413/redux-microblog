# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

-----------------------

Challenges for this project:

- I needed to think hard about how to manage my state. Trying to code too quickly, and developing my front end without configuring a workable state made me have to re-work many of my elements that I have already implemented in mocks. 

- Most of my issues in storing state were due to the structure of how I was storing data. I had stored my data in a structure like:

{
    {id, title, body, description, comments : [] ...},
    {id, title, body, description, comments : [] ...},
    {id, title, body, description, comments : [] ...}
}

Which had made it very difficult to update, and iterate through nested arrays like comments. I had solved this by moving to this structure:

{
    [id] : {title, body, description, comments: [] ...},
    [id] : {title, body, description, comments: [] ...},
    [id] : {title, body, description, comments: [] ...}
}

- I also did not read through the parameters of the project, which lead to mistakes down the road such as trying to manage more than one post in my state.
