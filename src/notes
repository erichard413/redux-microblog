Challenges for this project:

- I needed to think hard about how to manage my state. Trying to code too quickly, and developing my front end without configuring a workable state made me have to re-work many of my elements that I have already implemented in mocks. 

- Most of my issues in storing state were due to the structure of how I was storing data. I had stored my data in a structure like:

{
    {id, title, body, description, comments : [] ...},
    {id, title, body, description, comments : [] ...},
    {id, title, body, description, comments : [] ...}
}

Which had made it very difficult to update, and iterate through nested arrays like comments. I had solved this by moving to this structure:

{
    [id] : {title, body, description, comments: [] ...},
    [id] : {title, body, description, comments: [] ...},
    [id] : {title, body, description, comments: [] ...}
}

- I also did not read through the parameters of the project, which lead to mistakes down the road such as trying to manage more than one post in my state.
